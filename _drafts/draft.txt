### Projects
01. **MSnEAE**: Physicochemical role and potential inhibitor screening for the candidate biomarkers overexpressed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. <br>
Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj 8100, Bangladesh. Advisor: Mahbub Hasan, PhD. 2021-2022

02. **DEGnNGSanalysis**: Microarray Data Analysis Using GEO2R to Identify Differentially Expressed Genes in Ovarian Cancer after NSC319726 Treatment and Pathway Analysis.<br>
Prof. D Karunagaran's Cancer Biology Lab, Dept. of Biotechnology. Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 6000636, Tamil Nadu, India. Advisor: Professor Karunagaran D. Mar 2020- Sep 2020. 

03. **MMMDDynamics**: Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Molecular Docking & Data analysis.<br>
In this project I am keeping a record of essential resources, workplan and updates on python programming used in data analysis of molecular dynamics simulation and NGS data as well. 

04. **CODEnSEQ**: Learning tools like- Python, R, Ruby, Jekyll, HTML, illustration and other assets to give support my scientific projects.<br>
Depicting complex biological phenomenon in the form of flowchart, pathway and logical figure. I mostly used Inkscape and GIMP for the generation of biological illustrations and python for data analysis. Here I track record of these works.
